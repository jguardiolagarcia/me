## Notes

* How do you search files?
	With the command `find`. Find searches files recursively down a directory.
	`find` is included in alpine, but not `whereis` and `locate`. Those two need a database and probably the commands are properly indexed. They also wont restrict the search to a directory
	`ls`colud be easil yhacked to hide files from intruders but `find`is not that vulnerable.
* Diff bewtween `/tmp` and `/dev/shm`?
	`/dev/shm` is stored in RAM.
* UNIX philosophy, filters, pipes




## Commands
* `find . ` - sorto fo the same as `ls -l1`
* `find . -ls `
* find . -type `f` - find files in direcotry
* `find . -type f -name ".*"` - find files that starts with a dot.
* `find . -mtime -1` find files modified in the las 24 hours
* `find . -mmin -5 2>/dev/null >/tmp/foo` - finds files changed in the last 5 mins, didcard standard errors with `2>/dev/null` and redirect to file `/tmp/foo`
* `head -5 [file] ` - shows first 5 lines
* `tail -5 [file] ` - shows last 5 lines of file
