## Notes
* How to geet the ip of the VM if you don't know it.
* What is home directory? access only with user permissions (separated from system files)
* the file /etc/passwd has a line for each user account. We can see mor info with `man 5 passwd`
* the file /etc/skel is copied in a new user dierctory. Like a template.
* if you delete a user from a system, the files and ID related to that user are preserved
* `rmdir foo` remove an empty directory
* `rm -rf foo` remove a directory and all everything in it. (-f is for "foring" so we are not asked confirmation)

* `cp -ar dir anotherdir` recursively copy all files from `dir` to `anotherdir` but keeps original stamps
* `scp`copy between machines
* `touch` creates a new text file
* `grep foo file` - list only line containing foo
* `chown -R jill:jill foo` transfer ownership of all files in foo to other users (jill:jill-).
