WEEK 1

To investigate/read:
- Dig into ideas. Write about them. What about get a topic weekly and write something on sundays about it?.
- zettelkasten. Niklas Luhmann / "Personal Knowledge Graph"

Bootcamp

- zettelkasten implementation: Just to put things on notes, throw them without much filtering. 
MOST IMPORTANT: IT MUST BE SIMPLE AND USEFUL.
Recomendations:
	Title: less than 50 UNICODE char
	Body 25-30- lines (rob fits his screen to meet this condition)
	References including URL
	Tags on last line
	Stick with single level list
convention:
	Link to searches, not to content
	
- ISOSEC commits to github. Github allows a good search method.
- Zet repos with license -> Can create it in creativecommons


- Enterpirses use apache 2.0 because its more explicit about rights and permissions. You allow your stuff to be used at work-
- commonmark.org : site for markdown
